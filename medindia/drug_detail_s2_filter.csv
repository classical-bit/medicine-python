Atenolol is used to treat hypertension and angina and in stable heart attack patients to prevent death.,"Atenolol blocks beta-1 receptors, which are present on the heart. This prevents the action of nerve chemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. As a result, heart beats at a slower rate and with lesser force, and thus pumps out lesser blood into blood vessels. This action of atenolol reduces blood pressure in the hypertensive patients. Since the heart treated with atenolol beat slowly and with less force, it uses lesser energy thus relieving pain in angina and also reduces the risk of heart attack.  ",Atenolol is absolutely contraindicated in the patients with the following conditions:•	Clinical depression •	Known allergy to the drug •	Second or third degree heart block •	Persistent low heart rate (bradycardia) •	Poor blood circulation due to heart failure •	Tumour of adrenal gland called pheochromocytoma •	Pregnancy •	Breast feeding mother,The dosage of the drug varies as per the medical condition.•	In acute heart attack patient: Oral therapy with atenolol must be started once the patient is in a stable condition following the intravenous atenolol for acute heart attack.
